# Katalon-Studio-automated-Acceptance-Test---QAWorks-Contact-Form
This is a simple Acceptance Test example for "Contact Us" page on the QAWorks web site. 

# Prerequisites
The automated tests are ran using Katalon Studio with Git enabled on it. So, in order to build and run the tests it is necessary to have it installed on your local machine.

# Running the tests
After you have cloned the project, make sure the relevant path for the Data File on your local machine is selected prior to running the tests.

# Platform limitations
Currently, there are several issues related to cross browser testing, e.g. IE and Edge etc.

# Platform further capabilities
The tests can also be run on variety of different operating systems and devices, which I have not included in this example.
Projects can be easily be exported in C#, Java or the code can be manipulated in Script view.

# Highlights
This feature is actually not working as expected and its basic funcionality is broken. Emails are not being sent and an error message "THERE WAS AN ERROR TRYING TO SEND YOUR MESSAGE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER." is getting displayed instead of confirmation of email reception.

# Improvements
Once the "Contact Us" feature is functioning properly, a further safety improvment can be done by adding extra security and protection by implementing a Captcha, Math Question or "I'm not a robot" feature to the Contact form.
