# Katalon-Studio-automated-Acceptance-Test---QAWorks-Contact-Form
This is a simple Acceptance test example for the Contact Us page feature on the QAWorks web site. 

# Prerequisites
The automated tests are ran using Katalon Studio with enabled Git on it, so in order to build and run the tests it is necessary to have this on your local machine.

# Running the tests
When you have cloned the project, prior to running it, make sure the relevant path for the Data File on your local machine is selected.

# Platform limitations
As of now it's known that there are several issues related to cross browser testing, e.g. IE and Edge etc.

# Platform further capabilities
The tests can also be run on variety of different operating systems and devices, which I have not included it this example.
Projects can be easily exported for example in C#, Java or the code can be manipulated in Script view.

# Highlights
The feature is actually not working as expected and its basic funcionality is broken. Emails are not being sent and an error message "THERE WAS AN ERROR TRYING TO SEND YOUR MESSAGE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER." is getting displayed instead of confirmation of email reception.

# Improvements
Once the Contact Us feature is functioning properly a further safety improvent can be done by adding extra security and protection implementing a Captcha, Math Question or "I'm not a robot" feature to the Contact form.
